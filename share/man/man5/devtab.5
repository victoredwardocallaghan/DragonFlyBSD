.Sh NAME
.Nm devtab
.Nd label conversion file for device paths
.Sh DESCRIPTION
The
.Nm
file contains label conversions for
.Xr fstab 5 ,
.Xr mount 8 ,
.Xr hammer 8 ,
and other commands which expect device paths.
It is typically used to translate longer serial numbers (which
.Xr devfs 5
automatically creates as
.Pa /dev/disk/by-serno/<serial>[.suffix] )
into short form names.
.Pp
.Nm
is only read by programs, and not written;
it is the duty of the system administrator to properly create
and maintain this file.
Each conversion is described on a separate line;
fields on each line are separated by tabs or spaces.
.Pp
The first field specifies the conversion's label.
.Pp
The second field is the conversion's type.
Valid types are
.Bl -tag -width ".Sy serno" -offset indent
.It Sy serno
Translates to
.Pa /dev/disk/by-serno
.It Sy path
Translates to the path as specified
.El
.Pp
The third field specifies the conversion's base path
.Sh FILES
.Bl -tag -width ".Pa /etc/devtab" -compact
.It Pa /etc/devtab
The
.Nm
file resides in
.Pa /etc .
.El
.Sh EXAMPLES
This will translate references like
.Sy fubar ,
.Sy fubar.s1a
etc.\& to their
.Pa /dev/disk/by-serno/L123456
counterparts:
.Pp
.Dl "fubar        serno        L123456"
.Pp
This will translate references like
.Sy fubar ,
.Sy fubar.s1a
etc.\& to their
.Pa /full/path
counterparts:
.Pp
.Dl "fubar        path         /full/path"
